Create a class `WuTangConcatenator` which uses a composite `Integer` to identify divisibility.
    * Multiples of `3` are considered `Wu` numbers.
    * Multiples of `5` are considered `Tang` numbers.
    * Multiples of `3` and `5` are considered `WuTang` numbers.
    A composite number is a positive integer that can be formed by multiplying two smaller positive integers.
